// once (the baseline — today's single-shot behavior), sample junction
// contracts (full PVA) from that trajectory at equal time fractions, then
// re-plan each span with the SAME pipeline (fm2 + MINCO + L-BFGS), chaining
// the runs through the contracts: run N's tail BC and run N+1's head BC are
// the SAME prescribed state, so the stitched trajectory is C2 at every seam
// by construction — the report only confirms it.
//
// The contracts are sampled from the baseline rather than synthesized
// (level-cruise at the junction chord) because the baseline already knows
// what the unsplit optimum does there — climbing, banking — and pinning that
// exact state avoids manufacturing artificial level-outs at the seams. It
// also makes the comparison honest: baseline and chain share their junction
// states, so any shape difference between them is the split itself.
//
// Owned by the FSM, beside the state machine, not inside it: the state
// machine decides WHEN to plan; this component knows only how to turn one
// mission into N chained pipeline runs. PathManager stays a pure single-run
// pipeline throughout.
//
// Scope (deliberate, stage 1): single-goal missions, sequential runs. On any
// segment failure the baseline is restored and flown — the experiment
// degrades to today's behavior, loudly.
